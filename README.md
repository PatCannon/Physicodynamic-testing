Young's Modulus CSV analyser
Starrett FMS 500 produces numbered .csv files.
This program (YMCA), when placed in the same folder as a .csv file named "sample_stress_strain_curve.csv" will:

Scans columns for relevant data, exports into a new file, plots the data, and analyses for the fracture point and the linear fit of the slope just before. 
This is then used to provide the Young's modulus of compression in MPa. Finally, the new exported file is deleted, and the plot and data is saved.

Looking for more example data to optimise and train my programs!
Ideally physicodynamic testing like Young's moduli and rheology, but also interested in fatigue failure testing.
